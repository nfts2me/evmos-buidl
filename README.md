# NFTs2Me - Empowering NFT creators on EVMOS

Our goal is to make the process of creating, deploying, and managing your NFT collections as simple as possible, while providing advanced and unique features on EVMOS.

  
  

## What is NFTs2Me?

**[NFTs2Me](https://nfts2me.com/)** is a user-friendly comprehensive platform to create, deploy and manage your NFT collection and community, **100% free** with advanced functionalities. It embraces the three big pillars of the NFT life cycle: creation, deployment, and administration of the contract and the community, empowering NFT creators.

  

The **creation** pillar allows users to create their own NFTs artwork using a simple and user-friendly interface. Users can upload their own artwork or other digital assets or use our builtin generative art tool, and we'll guide them through the process of creating the metadata, defining its rarity, and uploading the collection to IPFS (a decentralized immutable file system) for free.

  

The **deployment** pillar allows users to create and deploy the NFT contract on the blockchain, making them immutable, verified and accessible to the public. Our optimized system offers ultra low contract deployment fees while keeping advanced functionalities, like different minting types, minting the NFTs on any ERC-20 (like bridged USDC or even COSMOS) or native coin (EVMOS), Soulbound tokens, on chain affiliation... Furthermore, we offer the possibility to use our upgradeable contracts to benefit from new upcoming features. When deploying a collection you'll receive an NFT that represents its ownership.

  

The **administration** pillar focuses on the management of collection including the community aspect of the life cycle. Create custom subdomains or minting widgets for your own website, allowlists, whitelists, airdrops, set the drop and end date, create token gated content only accessible for your owners.

  

Let's talk about some of this fantastic features that make NFTs2Me different.

  

## What makes NFTs2Me different?

### Artificial Intelligence to create NFTs

Would you like to create a collection but don't have the artwork? We got you covered! Just a few words to create the artwork of your NFTs as well as the description using AI.
  

### Anypayments & ERC-20 mintings

NFTs2Me allows to set the minting price not only in native, but also in any currency/ERC-20, and let the users mint in ERC-20 or native coin. Set a price in Native Coin (e.g. EVMOS) or ERC-20 (USDC, USDT, ATOM...). Let your users **mint your NFTs with anything** (Native or any ERC-20). We do a **transparent swap and mint** for the user in one transaction. The owner always receives in the defined payment.

  

### Collections as NFTs (Ownership)

When a new collection is deployed on the Blockchain, the owner will receive an NFT indicating its ownership of the deployed collection. The owner of the NFT will be the **owner of the collection**. Therefore, if you'd like to transfer the ownership of the collection, you'd just have to transfer the NFT to the new owner.

  

> The collection ownership is determined by an NFT we mint for you once you mint the collection. To transfer the ownership of the collection is as simple as transferring your ownership NFT.

  

When selling your collection you are selling the ownership as well as the owner's revenue (including secondary sales). **Just think about it and how powerful this is!**. The user is free to keep it or sell it (for instance, on OpenSea).

  

### Different minting types

**Sequential**, **Random** or **Specify minting** allow you to choose the minting behaviour on your collection. Over that, you can use a **Placeholder** to hide the actual metadata until you decide to reveal and fix on the blockchain.

  

> Minting Types are compatible with Placeholder. For instance, you can use Sequential Minting along with Placeholder to temporarily hide the metadata, and reveal at a later time.

  

-  **SEQUENTIAL MINTING**. It describe itself.

-  **SPECIFY MINTING**. Let your users decide their tokens.

-  **RANDOM MINTING**. Truly on-chain two-steps secure random minting.

  
  

### On-chain affiliation

  

Our on-chain affiliate system allows to reward both affiliates who help you sell the collection, as well as offer an optional discount for the end user coming from a affiliate link.

  

The **optional discount** is a great way to help promote your collection through affiliates, as these ensure that their audience will want to use their reference.

  

> You can choose to set a **general affiliation information** (commission and user discount), but you can also set a different and **custom per wallet affiliation information** (commission and user discount). That way, you can provide special commission conditions for top affiliates.

  

### Token Gating

  

Token gating is **a common tool used by NFT project teams to create value for community members**. Essentially, token gating allows projects to reward people who hold their NFTs by creating exclusive content, events, and other benefits available only to token holders.

Using our tools you'll be able to natively let your users (owner of NFTs from your collection) access exclusive content, exclusive Airdrops, ...

  
  

### Custom minting pages with free subdomain

Set up a **custom mint page** with your own subdomain to mint your NFTs or embed it in your website easily using our widget. You'll be able to set your own **custom subdomain** hosted by us or use you own website/domain.

  

### And much more!

  

Free IPFS-hosting, soulbound tokens, NFT holder snapshots, automatic logo and banner generation, split revenue, PSD support, airdrops with CSV batch sending, whitelisting, decentralized Governance and on-chain voting support, very gas efficient deployments...

  
  

## NFTs2Me ❤️ EVMOS

  

### EVMOS ERC-20 module

  

At NFTs2Me we leverages on some of the EVMOS primitives like Evmos’ ERC-20 module, which allows NFTs2Me to bridge EVM users to Cosmos ecosystem.

  

Using EVMOS ERC-20 module allows users to seamlessly integrate with Evmos and the Cosmos ecosystem using its liquidity. Using the x/erc20 module. Creators can build NFT Collections on Evmos and specify the minting price token in any ERC-20 EVMOS supported token.

  

We've added a bunch by default from https://app.evmos.org/assets for convenience, but you can add your own if needed.

  

More info at: https://medium.com/evmos/introducing-evmos-erc20-module-f40a61e05273

  

### ESCAN integration

  

We've integrated with [ESCAN](https://escan.live/) and verified our contracts (links below). Also, we've been helping to Victor from ESCAN to add a feature to allow minimal proxies to be automatically verified as well as 'paris' compilations support. Victor added both features in an incredible time! Kudos!

  

### EVMOS Revenue module

  

We have planned to add support for the revenue module. When creating an NFT collection, the collection owner will be entitled to register its collection on "dApp Store Contract Registration". Instead of keeping for us, 100% of the accrued revenue with go to the owner. That's a great way to, for instance, earn revenue with free minting NFT collections.

  

### EVMOS Direct Link

  

NFTs2Me is deployed both on Mainnet and Testnet. We going to [https://nfts2me.com/app/evmos/](https://nfts2me.com/app/evmos/) or [https://nfts2me.com/app/evmos-testnet/](https://nfts2me.com/app/evmos-testnet/), it will ask you to swap the current connected network to EVMOS (or EVMOS testnet) if you are not already connected, and also add the network if you don't have it already added.

  
  

### Experience developing on Evmos

  

Our experience developing on Evmos has been a mixed one. On the positive side, we have appreciated the vast range of possibilities it offers and the supportiveness of the development team. However, we would like to propose a few changes that could facilitate the onboarding process for new developers entering the Evmos ecosystem.

  

1.  **Focus on Solidity/EVM developers:** Given that contract development on Evmos is carried out in Solidity, it is likely that many EVM programmers come from that background. Providing an overview of the distinctions between traditional L1/L2 solutions and the unique features of Evmos, as well as its relationship with Cosmos, would be highly beneficial. This aspect represents a significant advantage of Evmos that could be further emphasized.

  

2.  **Streamline local node deployment:** Unfortunately, we encountered difficulties when attempting to deploy a local node due to private repositories not yet public, which hampered the efficiency of our testing process. However, we received valuable assistance from Vlad, who helped us resolve the issues we encountered. In the future, incorporating the ability to create a local node within the Evmos ecosystem would greatly enhance the development workflow.

  

Additionally, on behalf of the NFTs2Me team, we recommend changing the default scan on Chainlist ([https://chainlist.org/chain/9001](https://chainlist.org/chain/9001) and [https://chainlist.org/chain/9000](https://chainlist.org/chain/9000)) from `evm.evmos.dev` to `escan.live`. As many users add chains on Chainlist, this modification would enable them to conveniently view their transactions from Metamask or their wallets once they are added to the platform.

  

## The future of NFTs2Me

  

During the Hackathon we've deployed our tool on EVMOS's mainnet and testnet, so it can now be used to deploy NFTs projects on EVMOS's blockchain.

  

We've also received some request from the community to be more EVMOS native, which are being built at the moment. We're thrilled to continue listening to the community and making it easier to create, deploy, and manage NFT projects on EVMOS. We'll continue to implement new features as requested.

  

If we win the hackathon, we plan to **re-invest a part of the prize** to promote the **growth** and creation of NFT utility collections within the **EVMOS ecosystem** through:

  

* Quests/Competitions

* Direct rewards

* Raffles among creators

* Giving away our utility token (Booster Pack)

We want to continue building the most complete NFT toolkit for creators in the EVMOS ecosystem.
